Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was generally to create a banking application. 

What did you do particularly well?
I truly feel like this was my best work in the course as it not only worked but is the most efficient way I could do it.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I really would not make any changes. I feel like this was my best work.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The hardest part was really just formatting it so it would output things the way they were supposed to be.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I feel that the simplicity of the project cannot be overstated and is the most important piece to transfer to other works.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program is built in my opinion exactly to standard and is easy to read for anyone with basic c++ therefore easy to adapt and maintain.
